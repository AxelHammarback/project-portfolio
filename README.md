Portfolio for things I've mainly made during the Technigo bootcamp. 

## Accessibility measures
* Made sure tabbing works with links.
* Sounds okay with a screen reader.
* Added hidden text with class="sr-only" to make links make sense if you're using a screen reader.
* All text passes color contrast tests.
